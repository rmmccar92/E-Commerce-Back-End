## Description

This project required us to create a RESTful API in order to track a fictitious  e-commerce web application. In doing so we set up a server with node js and express and used sequelize to build the data-base. Finally we used Insomnia to test the requests as demonstrated below.
    
## Authors
    
Ryan McCarthy
    
## Usage
    
Once the server is started you can check your requests with Insomnia or another similar program.
